# SVD-Compressed_Image
MATLAB Function for Compressing Images With SVD

The function uses SVD decomposition to compress an image but is not just for the image you can use it to compress or approximate any matrix by sense of SVD decomposition.

For using this function you must first copy your image into the same directory or folder as this function and then run it .

Then the program shows you the original and compressed image together and creates the compressed image in your directory ( folder ) and you can compare the size of the two images.
